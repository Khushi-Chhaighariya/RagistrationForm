Creating a registration authentication form involves HTML for structure and CSS for styling. In HTML, you'll set up form elements like input fields for username, email, password, etc., wrapped in form tags. Each input will have attributes like type and name for data collection. CSS styles the form's layout, fonts, colors, and responsiveness for various devices. You'll likely utilize CSS for positioning elements, adding background images, and defining button styles. Additionally, CSS can enhance user experience through hover effects or error message displays. Together, HTML and CSS form the foundation for a visually appealing and functional registration authentication form.
